ðŸŽ¯ The objectives here are just make a consistancy of training inside some sort of languages starting from typescript that is not actually a language, it's a linter but you get the idea!

ðŸ‘‹ The problem solving will be done by doing 100% of each level inside a topic, starting from easy to hard.

### ðŸ¤– Automation scripts

`yarn start`: Will clone the template file from <a href="./templates/">Templates Folder</a> and write on top level as "Answer.ts"

`yarn end`: Will write you "answer.ts" file into the specified folder based on the exported variables on top of your answer file

`yarn build`: Will write a automated README, code after the commented tag down below

### ðŸ“– Now you will find the direct links from the files solved inside the difficulty labeled folders. <a href="./scripts/automaton.ts">see how it's automated </a>

<!-- Automated code down below! check automaton.ts -->
